##merkle-tree

Merkle tree(Hash trees) is used in distributed systems(and many other places) to detect differences between two large datasets by using minimal network transfers. More information is avaiable in wikipedia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree.

###### Idea behind the merkle-tree is as following

1. Divide the data into blocks, and compute digest(hash) of each block. 
2. All hashes of these blocks become leaves of a tree. Using these leaves, we can build the complete tree upto the root.
3. If we have the merkle-trees of two similar datasets, that will help in detecting whether those datasets are same, or differing, by comparing only these digests, and we can quickly figure out which blocks are differing.

##### Merkle-tree assumptions

1) Network transfers are costlier than local computing. Hence digest calculation is done(even though it is a heavy process, but cpu capacity is higher than network transfer capacity), and digest transferred through network, and that is used to detect inconsistencies, and it avoids unnecessary transfer entire block of data.

[Amazon Dynamo] (http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf) has used that in its implementation.
There are even few [opensource] (http://www.ccnx.org/releases/ccnx-0.6.0/javasrc/src/org/ccnx/ccn/impl/security/crypto/MerkleTree.java) implementations available. 

###### Problem
========
In one of my projects, we replicate some users' data acros multiple locations asynchronously. Replica nodes can differ from primary node's data for various reasons

1. Replica nodes can miss replication events from primary node due to operational error(like disabling replication, bringing up a node without bootstrapping the initial data), a node being down for a longer period of time.
2. software inconsistency between primary and replica(hence data generated by primary might be differing)
3. not following write path properly (for example, in Hbase you can disable writes write ahead log entry during batch loading, hence those events wont be replicated at all)

So we needed a system where it can detect inconsistency between primary and replica with minimal overhead, and also synchronize the replica's data if needed. Even though there are many opensource implementations of merkle tree available, its not equivalent to full serving system, those opensource implementations are main memory based, does not retain anything between restarts. So I have implemented a merkle-tree based system, and currently running in production.
